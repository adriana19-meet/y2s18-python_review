# Part 1: Create a class Superheros, where each
# superhero can be initialized with a name (a string),
# a superpower (a string), and their strength (an integer).

# Part 2: Write a function to print out the superhero's name and
# strength.

# Part 3: Sometimes, superheros use up a lot of
# strength to save someone. Write a function save_civilian,
# which takes in an input variable work, which is an integer
# and reduces the superhero's strength by work. That is,
# if work=3, and strength=5, then after saving the person,
# the superhero will have 2 strength points left.
